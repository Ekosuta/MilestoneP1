This project is supposed to an immitation of the popular pong game. Two players battle the ball back and forth until one is unable to reach the ball in time, resulting in a point for the opposing player.

The game is simple: Player 1 is on the left and uses keys "W" to move up, and "S" to move down, while player 2 is on the right and uses the up and down arrow keys.

To restart the game, press the restart button at the bottom. This will reset the score as well as the balls position!

Have fun!
